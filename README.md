# Phoenix Color Scheme for Vim

Monochrome Vim color scheme based on [Phoenix](https://github.com/netatoo/phoenix-theme).

## A Couple of Notes

- Might be slightly different from the original
- Terminal colors are much different and simplified
- Not entirely monochrome for improved usability (e.g. errors are red, diffs are green, yellow and red)
- Available colors: Blue (default), Red, Green, Yellow, Orange, Purple (not pink)
- Pull requests welcome
